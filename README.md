## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Enable GD Extension in `php.ini`

After cloning this project, you **must enable the GD extension** in PHP to avoid errors when generating PDFs or handling images.

### üõ† Steps to Enable GD Extension:
1. Open a terminal and run the following command to locate your active `php.ini` file:
   ```sh
   php --ini

   Example output:

   Configuration File (php.ini) Path:
    Loaded Configuration File:         C:\php-8.3.9\php.ini
    Scan for additional .ini files in: (none)
    Additional .ini files parsed:      (none)

2. Locate the "Loaded Configuration File" path in the output.
Example: C:\php-8.3.9\php.ini

3. Open the php.ini file in a text editor.

4. Find the following line:

    ```sh
    ;extension=gd

Remove the semicolon (;) at the beginning to enable it:

    extension=gd

5. Save the file and restart your server:

    ```sh
    php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000

6. Verify that GD is enabled:

    ```sh
    php -r "echo extension_loaded('gd') ? 'GD is enabled' : 'GD is NOT enabled';"
